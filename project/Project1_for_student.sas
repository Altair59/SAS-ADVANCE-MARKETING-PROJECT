/*
backgroud of the data:
The develop data set is a retail-banking example.
the data set has 32264 cases (banking customers) and 47 input variables;
The binary target variable Ins indicates whether the customer has an
insurance product.
The 47 input variables represent other product usage and demographics
prior to their acquiring the insurance product

/* 	copy to temporary working library */

 

/*use proc contents to check the data first*/


/*we can copy the result to Excel to track and document in the future*/


/*then we found there are numeric and categorical variales*/

/*1.1 explore numeric variables
*********************************/

/* in SAS we use proc mean to generate descriptive statistics for the numeric
variables, for example: */ 
proc means data=develop n nmiss mean min max;
	var acctage;

/* let check 2 more variables: dda ddabal */


/*I want to check all numeric variables - there are so many and i do not want to
type all variables one by one*/
/*Use Excel and txt editor to improve efficiency*/




/*but what if in the following step, i need to use all these numeric
variables again. I need to reduce the amount of text I enter or even copy again
and again in my other codes*/
/*Let us use macro variable to solve this:
Recall: the %Let statement enables you to define a macro variable Inputs */

/*then use input in proc means*/


/*key findings from proc meanns:
--several variables have missing values - we need to clean the data first!

/*1.1 explore categorical(nominal) variables
*********************************/
/*use proc freq to examines categorical variables and target variables*/



/*key findings from proc freq:
-- 34.6% of observations have acquired the insurance product
-- 19 levels of Branch and 3 levels under Res (R=rural, S=suburb, U=urban)
	



/* 2. Introduction to the Logistic Procedure
***********************
***********************
**************************/
/*
--The LOGGISTIC procedure fits a binary logistic regression model.*/

/*try out a basic logistic regression first*/

proc logistic data=develop; 
   model ins = CDBAL IRA IRABAL LOC LOCBAL;
run;
/*2.1 sometimes, we need to put classification variables into the model:

--The Class statement names the classsification variables to be used in the analysis
  The Class statement must precede the Model statement
  The PARAM option in the Class statement specifies the parameterization method for the
  classification variables
  Ref option specifies the reference level - in this example, the parameterization method is 
  reference cell coding the reference level is S*/
  




/*Key points:

-- Use the DES option to reverse the order so that PROC LOGISTIC models the probability that Ins=1;
   Otherwise, the PROC LOGISTIC will model the probabily that Ins=0
*/



/*2.1 The odds ratio  is defined as the ratio of the odds for those with the risk factor () 
to the odds for those without the risk factor ():

The odds ratio measures the effect of the input variable on the target adjusted for the effect of the other
input variables. For example, the odds of acquiring an insurance product for DDA (checking account)
customers is .379 times the odds for non-DDA customers. Equivalently, the odds of acquiring an
insurance product is 1/.379 or 2.64 times more likely for non-DDA customers compared to DDA
customers. Therefore odds raio is useful for baniry variables*/


/*-- For continuous variables, it may be useful to convert the odds ratio to a percentage increase or decrease in
odds.
The UNITS statement enables you to obtain an odds ratio estimate for a specified change in an input
variable. In this example, let us use UNITS Statement to estimate the change in odds for a 1000-unit
change in DDABal and DepAmt.*/



/*
the odds ratio for a 1000-unit change in DDABal is 1.074. Consequently, the odds of
acquiring the insurance product increases 7.4% (calculated as 100(1.07-1)) for every thousand-dollar
increase in the checking balance, assuming that the other variables do not change.
*/
/*
The four rank correlation indexes (Somerâ€™s D, Gamma, Tau-a, and c) are computed from the numbers of
concordant and discordant pairs of observations. In general, a model with higher values for these indexes
(the maximum value is 1) has better predictive ability than a model with lower values for these indexes.
*/


/* 3. Score the dataset
***********************
***********************
**************************/

/*no target variable in the new dataset, which is normal*/

/*3.1 Use score statement to score the dataset*/


/*run proc contents to check what scored data look like*/




/*3.2 OUTEST= Option and use the SCORE Procedure*/

/* -- The LOGISTIC procedure outputs the final parameter estimates to a data set using the OUTEST= option.*/




/*
The output data set contains one observation and a variable for each parameter estimate. The estimates are
named corresponding to their input variable*/


/*
The SCORE procedure multiplies values from two SAS data sets, 
-- one containing coefficients (SCORE=)
   and the other containing the data to be scored (DATA=). 
-- Typically, the data set to be scored would not
   have a target variable. 
-- The OUT= option specifies the name of the scored data set created by PROC
   SCORE. 
-- The TYPE=PARMS option is required for scoring regression models.*/



/*Key finding:
Different from SCORE statement in PROC Logistic Procedure
,the linear combination produced by PROC SCORE (the variable Ins) estimates the logit, not the
posterior probability. The logistic function (inverse of the logit) needs to be applied to compute the
posterior probability.*/




/*Data can also be scored directly in PROC LOGISTIC using the OUTPUT statement, which is a better way*/
